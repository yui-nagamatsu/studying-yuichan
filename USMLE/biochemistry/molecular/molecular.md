# BIOCHEMISTRY - MOLECULAR
## chromatin structure
DNA loops twice around a histone octamer.  
Histones are **larg**e and have + charge from **l**ysin and **arg**inine.  
Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is circular and does not utilize histones.  
Heterochromatin: ↑ methylation, ↓ acetylation

### TERMS
- octamer
  - a polymer formed from eight molecules of a monomer
- miosis
  - a process that takes place in the nucleus of a dividing cell
- CpG islands
  - regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' → 3' direction. In humans, about 70% of promoters contain a CpG island.
- Fragile X syndrome (FXS)
  - a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ in males with FXS is under 55, while about two thirds of affected females are intellectually disabled. Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles. About a third of those affected have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech. Hyperactivity is common, and seizures occur in about 10%. Males are usually more affected than females. There is no cure. Early intervention is recommended, as it provides the most opportunity for developing a full range of skills.
